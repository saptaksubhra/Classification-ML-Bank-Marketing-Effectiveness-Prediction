Marketing is the most common method which many companies are using to sell their products, services and reach out to the potential customers to increase their sales. Telemarketing is one of them and most useful way of doing marketing for increasing business and build good relationship with customers to get business for a company.
It’s also important to select and follow up with those customers who are most likely to subscribe product or service. There are many classification models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, ANN and Support Vector Machines (SVM) that can be used for classification prediction.

# Project Background
Nowadays, marketing spending in the banking industry is massive, meaning that it is essential for banks to optimize marketing strategies and improve effectiveness. Understanding customers’ need leads to more effective marketing plans, smarter product designs and greater customer satisfaction.

# Abstract
Finance industry is one of the leading industries globally and have the potential to bring huge impact in the growth of nation.

Thus, it is important to analyze the data or information that banking sector records about the clients. This data can be used to create connection and keep professional relationship with the customers in order to target them individually for any banking schemes. Usually, the selected customers are contacted directly through: personal contact, telephone cellular, email or any other means of contact to advertise the new services or give an offer.

This kind of marketing is called direct marketing and is one of the leading marketing techniques.

Thus, in this project we trained a model that can predict that whether the client will opt for a term deposit or not using given bank-client data, data related with the last contact of the current campaign and some other useful attributes.
